Ahh right 👍 you want the **actual answers** for the OOP MCQs part (not just the questions).
Here’s a clean list you can memorize fast:

# 📝 OOP MCQ Quick Answers

1. **What is Encapsulation?**
   → Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class).

2. **What is Inheritance?**
   → Creating a new class from an existing one to reuse code.

3. **What is Polymorphism?**
   → Same function/method name behaves differently depending on object/class.

4. **What is Abstraction?**
   → Hiding implementation details and showing only the functionality.

5. **Class vs Object?**

   * Class = blueprint.
   * Object = instance of class.

6. **Constructor in Python?**
   → `__init__(self, ...)`

7. **Access modifiers?**

   * Public: normal variables (`var`).
   * Protected: single underscore (`_var`).
   * Private: double underscore (`__var`).

8. **What is `self` in Python?**
   → Reference to current instance of the class.

9. **Static vs Class vs Instance method?**

   * **Instance method** → `def foo(self):` (default, works on object).
   * **Class method** → `@classmethod` (first arg is `cls`).
   * **Static method** → `@staticmethod` (no `self`, no `cls`).

10. **What is Method Overriding?**
    → Child class redefining a parent class method.

11. **Does Python support method overloading?**
    → No (last defined method wins). But can mimic using default args / `*args`.

12. **What is Multiple Inheritance?**
    → Class inheriting from more than one parent. Python supports it.

👉 These are the **exact type of MCQ answers** they ask — usually single-line, conceptual.

Do you want me to also make **MCQ-style sample questions with 4 options and correct answer marked** (like a mini practice set)?
