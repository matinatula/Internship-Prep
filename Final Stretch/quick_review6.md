Got it 👍 Thanks for sharing the details!

Here’s a **breakdown of what you should focus on for the Leapfrog on-site exam** based on the topics they’ve hinted at:

---

## ✅ MCQs (3 Questions)

These are likely to test **basic programming concepts** in the language you choose (Python, JS, Java, C, or C++).
Possible areas:

* List comprehension (syntax & usage in Python, or equivalent in other languages)
* Time complexity of array operations (searching/sorting)
* Tree traversal concepts (in-order, pre-order, post-order, BFS/DFS)

👉 Revise **definitions, outputs of small snippets, and time complexities**.

## ✅ Coding Questions (2 Questions)

Based on the list they gave, here’s what you should prepare:

### 1. **List Comprehension (Python focus)**

* Generating squares, filtering even numbers, nested loops in list comprehension.
  Example:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [x*x for x in nums]          # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
evens = [x for x in nums if x % 2 == 0] # [2, 4]
```

---

### 2. **Matrix Manipulation**

* Rotate matrix (90° clockwise / anticlockwise)
* Transpose matrix
* Spiral traversal

Example (transpose):

```python
matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
transpose = [[matrix[j][i] for j in range(len(matrix))] for i in range(len(matrix[0]))]
# [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]
```

---

### 3. **Array Searching**

* Linear search
* Binary search (classic interview Q)

Example (binary search):

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    l, r = 0, len(arr)-1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l+r)//2
        if arr[mid] == target: return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target: l = mid+1
        else: r = mid-1
    return -1
```

---

### 4. **Array Sorting**

* Bubble sort, Insertion sort (basic)
* Python built-in `sorted()` and its time complexity (Timsort → O(n log n))
* Maybe quicksort/mergesort concept

---

### 5. **Tree Traversal**

* Preorder (root → left → right)
* Inorder (left → root → right)
* Postorder (left → right → root)
* BFS/Level-order

Example (inorder traversal in Python):

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.left = self.right = None

def inorder(root):
    if root:
        inorder(root.left)
        print(root.val, end=" ")
        inorder(root.right)
```

---

## 🎯 Final Strategy (since you’re short on time)

1. Revise **syntax + list comprehension tricks**.
2. Practice **2–3 easy-medium problems** on HackerRank/LeetCode about **matrix + array**.
3. Quickly revise **binary search + sorting concepts**.
4. Memorize **tree traversals** (code patterns).
5. Sleep early and be at Leapfrog by 7:45 am sharp.

Do you want me to **make a 1-page cheat sheet** (Python-focused, since that’s simplest for interviews) with all these key codes + complexities so you can quickly revise before the exam?
