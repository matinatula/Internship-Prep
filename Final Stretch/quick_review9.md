Perfect ðŸ‘Œ letâ€™s **lock down the most likely exam set** so you donâ€™t waste energy on low-probability stuff.

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Most Likely **MCQs (3 Qs)**

Based on Leapfrogâ€™s pattern + the topics they listed:

1. **Binary Search Best Case Complexity**

* A) O(1) âœ…
* B) O(log n)
* C) O(n)
* D) O(n log n)

ðŸ‘‰ They love testing **time complexity basics**.

---

2. **Python List Comprehension Output**

```python
[x for x in range(6) if x % 2 == 0]
```

* A) `[1,3,5]`
* B) `[0,2,4]` âœ…
* C) `[2,4,6]`
* D) Error

ðŸ‘‰ Quick check if you know Python syntax well.

---

3. **Tree Traversal Definition**
   Pre-order traversal visits nodes in which order?

* A) Left â†’ Root â†’ Right
* B) Root â†’ Left â†’ Right âœ…
* C) Left â†’ Right â†’ Root
* D) Right â†’ Left â†’ Root

ðŸ‘‰ Almost guaranteed, since they mentioned tree traversal explicitly.

---

âœ… If you nail these 3, youâ€™ll be ready even if they twist the wording.

---

# ðŸŽ¯ Most Likely **Coding (2 Qs)**

They will almost certainly pick **one matrix** and **one array/tree** problem.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Coding Q1 (Matrix â€” Very High Probability)

**Rotate a matrix 90Â° clockwise.**

```python
def rotate(matrix):
    return [list(row)[::-1] for row in zip(*matrix)]

matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
print(rotate(matrix))  
# [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ Coding Q2 (Array Searching â€” High Probability)

**Binary Search implementation.**

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    l, r = 0, len(arr)-1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l+r)//2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    return -1

print(binary_search([1,2,3,4,5], 4))  # 3
```

---

âœ… If they decide to swap searching with tree traversal, expect:

**Inorder Traversal of a Binary Tree**

```python
def inorder(root):
    if root:
        inorder(root.left)
        print(root.val, end=" ")
        inorder(root.right)
```

# ðŸš€ Quick Recap for You

* **MCQs likely** â†’ Binary search complexity, list comprehension output, tree traversal definition.
* **Coding likely** â†’ Rotate matrix 90Â°, Binary Search.
