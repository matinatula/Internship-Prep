Perfect â€” letâ€™s get you **fully ready for the MCQs part** âœ…

Since theyâ€™ve hinted at **list comprehension, matrix, array searching/sorting, and tree traversal**, the 3 MCQs will almost certainly be from these areas.
Iâ€™ll give you **all possible MCQ-style questions** (with answers) that can appear.
